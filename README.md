![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd58183c-5e46-46f3-b061-a5814256c1ac)

This repository contains a collection of complex mathematical functions implemented in Python. The functions cover a wide range of mathematical operations, including linear algebra, signal processing, numerical integration, and machine learning.

## Features

- Linear algebra operations: matrix inversion, LU decomposition, QR decomposition, etc.
- Signal processing: FFT, IFFT, wavelet transform.
- Numerical methods: Gaussian quadrature, Runge-Kutta, Monte Carlo integration.
- Machine learning: SVM, PCA, NMF.
- Complex functions: FFT, IFFT, complex matrix operations, etc.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn pywt emd
```

## Usage

You can import and use the functions directly in your Python scripts. For example:

```python
from your_module import complex_fft_filter

# Example usage
result = complex_fft_filter(signal, filter_function)
```
